# REACT-LESSONS-INSTRUCTOR-ANDRES-R.-BUCHELI

## Take a look to the live example at:
https://bucheli-web-development-react-course-intro-to-lifecyble.netlify.app/

## Usage:
* Accessing dynamic information with this.state.
* To make a component have state, give the component a state property. This property should be declared inside of a constructor method.
* this.state should be equal to an object.
* Use of the first lifecycle methods during the mounting phase: constructor(), and render().
